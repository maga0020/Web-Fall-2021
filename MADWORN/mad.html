The quote machine below shares fashion tips. The advice is a slim understanding of a persons style becoming a form of art and mastery. You'll notice that among these tips, there is no mention of a hoard-like, ridiculously excessive amount of clothing. Essentially the definition of my wardrobe prior to <span class="MADWORN">MADWORN</span>.

<p id="description2">Piece by piece I decided what was a worthy piece - worthy being a statement piece, a perfectly fitting piece, or a basic necessity; I got rid of the rest. My photographer and I spent countless hours creating outfits, posing, and enhancing lighting to depict the utmost desirable clothing. The name was a combination of my name - <span class="MADWORN">MADISON</span> - and the reality of the clothing - <span class="MADWORN">WORN</span>. The fish is an ode to living in Florida. The fish design was created with friendly and approachable intentions. Once the logo was created and the photos were edited - everything went to DePop. A platform that not only serves the purpose of a hobby, design experience, and profit generator but a sustainable platform.

Turning <span class="MADWORN">MADWORN</span> into something bigger is something I look forward to.

Don't get MAD, just wear WORN!</p>
